    'Big Sur Retreat',
    'Big Sur is big country. The Big Sur Retreat takes you to the most majestic part of the Pacific Coast and show you the secret trails.',
    'The region know as Big Sur is like Yosemite''s younger cousin, with all the redwood scaling, rock climbing and, best of all, hiking that the larger park has to offer. Robison Jeffers once said, ''Big Sur is the greatest meeting of land and sea in the world,'' but the highlights are only accessible on foot.\nOur 3-day tour allows you to choose from multiple hikes led by experienced guides during the day, while comfortably situated in the evenings at the historic Big Sur River Inn. Take a tranquil walk to the coastal waterfall at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Par or hike to the Married Redwoods. If you''re prepared for a more strenuous climb, try Ollason''s Peak in Toro Park. An optional 4th day includes admission to the Henry Miller Library and the Point Reyes Lighthouse.',

    'In the Steps of John Muir',
    'Follow in the steps on John Muir, famous naturalist and founder of the Sierra Club, and walk the same trails he helped blaze in and around Yosemite National Park.',
    'John Muir famously walked from San Francisco to Yosemite, an astounding 300 miles, and this tour is designed to trace his steps-- at least part of the way.\nThis tour is not for the faint of heart though. This is a true backpacker''s adventure, 37 miles in 3 days. Along the way, you''ll bear witness to the classic monuments of Yosemite, such as Vernal Falls, Nevada Falls, Half Dome, Cathedral Peak, Tuolumne Meadows and Mt. Lyell. At Nevada Falls, the trail becomes narrow and from then on, You''ll be privy to a ''secret'' Yosemite, including a rarely seen face of Half Dome. John Muir Trail tickets are required- and hard to come by- but Explore California has you covered. We''ll also provide a checklist so that you come prepared with the right equipment and a seasoned guide for your tour.',
